# Hi, I'm Majid Naeimi 👋  
### Expert in Robust Sensor Data Analysis • Physics-Informed Machine Learning • Anomaly Detection

I help companies turn **raw, noisy, imperfect sensor data** into reliable insights.  
My background is in satellite gravimetry and large-scale physical measurement systems, where data is complex, noisy, incomplete, and high-stakes.  
This gives me a unique edge: **I understand sensors not only statistically — but physically.**

- **Sensor Data Analysis** (industrial, environmental, physical systems)  
- **Anomaly & Drift Detection** (Isolation Forest, physical-model-based detection, hybrid ML)  
- **Time-Series Modeling**  
- **Predictive Maintenance**  
- **Signal Processing & Noise Modeling**  
- **Machine Learning for Real-World Sensors**  

My strength: **bridging physics and data science** for robust and interpretable results.

## 🧭 Industry Experience

### Bosch — Next-Generation Automotive Navigation Sensors
At Bosch, I work on the development of next-generation navigation sensors for the automotive industry.  
My focus is on **data evaluation, statistical performance analysis, and compliance with safety-critical integrity requirements**.

Key responsibilities include:

- evaluation and statistical analysis of large-scale **vehicle sensor data**  
- assessment of **customer integrity requirements** using extreme value theory (EVT)  
- modeling and prediction of **Hazardously Misleading Information (HMI)**  
- development of methods to quantify the reliability, robustness, and safety of navigation sensor outputs  
- translating statistical findings into engineering decisions for sensor design and validation

This role strengthened my expertise in safety-critical sensor performance, real world automotive data and robust statistical modeling, directly complementing my scientific background in complex measurement systems.
